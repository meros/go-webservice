go-webservice
=============

A web service using go/protobuf

This is a testbed for a bigger idea. Right now it's a simple rpc over http using protobuf for serialization. The bigger idea is to automatically generate server and client stubs where you can easily hook in custom code for:

Server side:
* go

Client side:
* go
* js
* c++
